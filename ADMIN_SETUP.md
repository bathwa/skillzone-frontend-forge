# Admin Authentication Setup

## Environment Variables

To secure admin authentication, set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Admin Authentication
VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL_1=abathwabiz@gmail.com
VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL_2=admin@abathwa.com
VITE_ADMIN_KEY=your_secure_admin_key_here

# API Configuration
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:54321

# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables
- Moved hardcoded admin credentials to environment variables
- Admin emails and key are now configurable via `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL_1`, `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL_2`, and `VITE_ADMIN_KEY`

### 2. Route Protection
- Created `AdminRoute` component for proper route-level protection
- Admin routes are now wrapped with authentication and authorization checks
- Non-admin users are automatically redirected to `/dashboard`

### 3. Component-Level Security
- Removed redundant admin role checks from `AdminDashboard` component
- Route protection now handles all authorization logic

### 4. Authentication Flow
- Admin emails trigger a special admin key input form
- Admin key validation before granting admin access
- Proper role assignment during login process

## Usage

1. Set the environment variables in your deployment platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
2. Admin users can log in using their admin email
3. They will be prompted for the admin key
4. Upon successful authentication, they'll be redirected to `/admin/dashboard`

## Security Recommendations

1. **Use strong admin keys**: Generate a secure random string for `VITE_ADMIN_KEY`
2. **Limit admin emails**: Only add necessary admin email addresses
3. **Server-side validation**: Implement server-side admin role validation
4. **Session management**: Consider implementing session timeouts for admin sessions
5. **Audit logging**: Log admin actions for security monitoring

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure environment variables are set in your deployment platform
- The admin authentication system is now more secure and configurable
- Route protection prevents unauthorized access to admin features
